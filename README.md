my journey for becoming (energetically) sober

**Fall 2022**.

The "special operation" leaded by Russia is gaining momentum in Europe.
Gas price is rising more and more.
Time is crucial, we must do our part.

As the french government has decided, we should reduce heat to 19Â°c into our houses. ðŸ˜…

Well, that's niceâ€¦ but how could we be smarter? Which are devices consuming the most? What does it happen if we reduce the temperature by 1 degrees?

We need to monitor at least 2 things at home :

- temperature
- and power consumption

> "By gaining knowledge, we make better decisions" - myself

# Summary ðŸ‘‡

- Build [the cheapest temperature sensor](cheapest-temperature-sensor.md) (for dummies)
- A way to [collect power consumption from Linky](collect-data-from-linky.md)
- [How to display data history](display-data-history.md)
- coming soon - What I've learned
  - How long does it take to gain 1Â°c in a room ?
  - How long does it take to lose 1Â°c in a room ?
  - What is the benefit of using a wood stove ?
    - When is the best moment do start it ?
    - How long does it keep the heat in the house ?
